# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Fulcro codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Fulcro** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Fulcro** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

# Getting started

## For npm users

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## For clojure users

Start a clojure REPL with `dev` alias

```bash
clj -A:dev
```

Run `(user/-main)` inside the REPL.

```clojure
(user/-main)
;; then connect to 'http://localhost:8080'
```
